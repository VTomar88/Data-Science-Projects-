## Factors Affecting Health Insurance Charges for XYZ Insurance Company
### Author: Varsha Tomar

### Introduction
This project aims to investigate the factors that influence health insurance charges for XYZ Health Insurance Company, a major insurance provider in the USA. The project utilizes a dataset collected over one year [1] and applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and linear regression modeling techniques to understand the key drivers of insurance charges.

### Method
#### Data Cleaning: 
The dataset was thoroughly cleaned to address any missing values. Missing values were replaced with appropriate measures such as mean or median values.
#### Data Transformation: 
Categorical variables such as sex, smoker status, and region were converted into numerical values using dummy variables.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Various EDA techniques were employed, including correlation analysis and the creation of graphs such as bar plots, scatter plots, and box plots, to gain insights into the relationships between different factors and insurance charges.
#### Linear Regression Modeling: 
A linear regression model was developed to predict insurance charges based on features such as age, BMI, sex, smoking status, number of children, and region. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model's performance was evaluated using the R-squared value.

### Results and Discussion
The analysis revealed several key findings:
Smoking status exhibited the strongest correlation with insurance charges, with smokers having significantly higher charges compared to non-smokers.
Age, BMI, and the Southeast region also demonstrated significant effects on insurance charges.
The number of children did not show a significant relationship with insurance charges.
The linear regression model achieved a reasonable R-squared value of 0.799 on the test set, indicating its ability to predict charges within 20% of the actual values.

### Ethical Concerns and Risks
Some ethical concerns and risks associated with this project include:
#### Privacy: 
Ensuring the privacy of individuals and protecting personal data collected for analysis.
#### Bias: 
Avoiding bias in data analysis by ensuring the data used is representative and unbiased.
#### Discrimination: 
Preventing the use of analysis results to discriminate against certain groups or individuals.
#### Misuse of results: 
Ensuring that the results of the analysis are used ethically and not for unfair financial gain or discrimination.
#### Informed consent: 
Obtaining informed consent from individuals whose data is used for analysis and informing them about the risks associated with the analysis.

### Conclusion
The linear regression model developed in this project successfully predicts health insurance charges based on various factors. The model can be utilized by insurance companies to forecast charges for potential customers and identify the key drivers of insurance costs. Further research can be conducted to enhance the model's performance and compare it with alternative machine learning algorithms.
